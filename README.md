# Temporal default .github files

Temporal's default community health files. See docs: https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file


## What is this

This is the default file for all Temporal OSS repos. Primarily we offer:

- 2 basic issue templates, covering Bug Report and Feature Requests
- 1 PR template, reminding the contributor to file an issue first
- in future, we may add [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha) and SECURITY.md


## Why do this

The goal of this is to make a small nudge to improve our OSS community submissions, and set public expectations on PRs.

## Internal instructions

To Temporal employees: You can override this behavior on a per-repo basis, simply by making another file with the same names in side of your repo. [More details in GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

You can also improve your issue triage by [using saved replies](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply) to [close issues with a polite and reasonable tone](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-art-of-closing/).
