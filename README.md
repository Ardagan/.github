# Temporal default .github files

Temporal's default community health files. See docs: https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file


This is the default file for all Temporal OSS repos. Primarily we offer:

- 2 basic issue templates, covering Bug Report and Feature Requests
- 1 PR template, reminding the contributor to file an issue first
- in future, we may add CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md

The goal of this is to make a small nudge to improve our OSS community submissions, and set public expectations on PRs.

To Temporal employees: You can override this behavior on a per-repo basis, simply by making another file with the same names in side of your repo. [More details in GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
